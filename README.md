# Unity Movement AI
**Unity Movement AI** is a library of common movement AI scripts known as Steering Behaviors. You can use these scripts to help your NPCs move around your game.

# How to Use
If you want to add this library to your game then import the [**unity-movement-ai.package**](https://github.com/antonpantev/unity-movement-ai/raw/master/unity-movement-ai.unitypackage). This package includes all of the movement scripts along with some premade game objects that use the scripts. 

Feel free to only use what you need from the package.

#Examples
If you would like to play around with the library then download this whole repository and open it in unity. The **Examples** folder holds a number of premade scenes for you to play around with.

Here are some previews of the different movement AI that come with this library.
